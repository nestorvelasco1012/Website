									The Inventory Management App, designed for a company located in Matamoros Tamaulipas, Mexico, serves as a comprehensive solution for managing inventory from the main 
									production area. With five tortillerias and eleven routes, this app streamlines the inventory tracking process and offers several 
									functionalities to enhance operational efficiency.
								</p>
								<p>
									The app allows the production area to mark the destinations of the products by utilizing iPads assigned to them. 
									It provides a user-friendly interface displaying all available products and the quantity of empty labeled bags in stock. 
									Moreover, the app enables the creation of a product list for each route, facilitating better planning and organization.

								<p>
									To further optimize operations, the app connects with an Epson printer, allowing easy receipt printing. 
									The receipts serve two purposes: one copy is retained by the production area, while the other is given to the delivery driver. 
									These receipts contain essential information such as the date, updates on items, product types, destinations, and invoice numbers. 
									Additionally, there are designated lines for signatures from both the production area and the delivery driver. 
								</p>
								<div class="image img">

								</div>
								<p>
									The receipts are categorized into three types: Cold Tortillas, Inventory, and Waste Material.
									The Inventory Management App not only improves inventory control but also enhances accuracy in tracking product destinations. 
									This enables administrators to monitor the total number of bags in storage and make informed decisions regarding the transfer of bags into the production area, 
									ensuring better control over the outgoing products. Furthermore, the app provides a platform for the routes to drop off their credits for the day,
									which are then received and printed on a receipt.

									In addition to its core functionalities, the app offers additional features that contribute to its usefulness. 
									Administrators have the ability to export data as an Excel sheet for further analysis and management. The app maintains a comprehensive history of all receipts 
									created, allowing easy access to past records. Moreover, there is an option to overwrite any receipts if necessary.

									Overall, the Inventory Management App plays a vital role in efficiently managing inventory and accurately tracking product destinations within the company's operations. 
									By leveraging this app, the company has significantly improved its inventory management process, ensuring that products are delivered to their intended destinations.
